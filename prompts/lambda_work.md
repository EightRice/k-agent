In your working folder there is a file called baseDAOdocs.md that explains how the DAO contract works on Tezos. Our task is to successfully make a contract call of type add_handler, and add another simple function to the contract. You have the contract_interaction tool for calling the contract and you may experiment with different versions of structuring the proposal_metadata parameter, based on your what the docs suggest and the response you get from the tool. While it's not clear how exactly to structure and encode the data, the docs are clear that we only need three fields: `handler_name`, `code` and `handler_check`. So please don't experiment with other fields, we just need to find the correct way of packing and sending these three. Know that the tool will relay the error from the RPC code if the call wasn't successfull, which is your cue to continue iterating. Also in your working folder, there is a file called prepare_metadata.py which is the script you will need to iterate upon until you achieve a successful execution of the contract_interaction tool. Please know that you can't install any additional modules, and we can't use the pytezos python library. Feel free to search online for relevant information as you iterate the python script to find the appropriate way to format and encode this parameter. You should submit your iteration every time as a hex string, but feel free to experiment with different ways of producing that hex string, but without trying to add other fields. Don't try to iterate on the handler name, as that is sure to be unique, instead try different ways of structuring the three fields.
